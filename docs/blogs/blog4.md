# New Vassar Induction Stoves

The use of induction stoves as an alternative to gas stoves has gained traction in recent years. After the in-class evaluation of the Bank of America ATM, I wanted to perform a cognitive walkthrough on using induction stoves.

This is an induction stove in New Vassar, which my friends and I worked a lot with over IAP. The first action a user might perform is putting some cookware on it. However, due to how induction stovetops generate heat, only certain types of cookware work with them. Typically, cookware with cast iron or stainless steel works while aluminum or copper doesn't. Not sure if this is common knowledge, but I think this is information pretty difficult for a user to know without a Google search or something. Noticing the action is available should be pretty obvious if the user is intending to cook. Now, how does the user know if they have done the right thing, or in other words, used a valid cookware? The answer with these induction stoves is that you can't. Regardless of what cookware you place on the stovetop, there is a beeping sound as feedback of knowing the cookware is there. Then, you would turn the fire, and after a long while, you notice your water is not boiling. Thus, the only way to know if the cookware was suitable with the stove is to actually test it by turning up the heat. Increasing heat is an indicator for understanding that a user made progress towards their larger goal of cooking a meal.

In conjunction with the first step, another action a user would probably take is selecting one of four sections of the stove to use. If you looked at the first image above, it's pretty difficult to spot that there are indicators that associate each knob with a section (which is much clearer when zoomed in on second image). The information is there but may not be easy to spot; maybe another color that contrasts black would help. After placing the cookware on the section you want and turning the knob, there isn't really an indicator that tells you that you placed it on the right place other than the heat.

Another piece of information about these stoves is that the smallest section (middle top) cooked the fastest while the largest section cooked the slowest, so it seems like there's some association with the size of the section and its heat generation. This information was definitely not common sense to my friends and I, and we only discovered it after cooking countless meals. I don't know if there's more expensive and higher quality induction stoves out there, but after my experiences, I have a strong preference of gas stoves over induction stoves.
