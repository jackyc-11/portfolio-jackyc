# IBM Careers Gestalt Principles

It was really interesting to see in class how the Gestalt principles affect the way our eyes perceive objects and their functionalities, so I wanted to explore the Gestalt principles on IBM's career page.

I primarily chose to explore IBM because its unique logos immediately came to mind when thinking about closure and proximity of the Gestalt principles. Firstly, the word logo is constructed with eight horizontal lines that have gaps in between. By the closure principle, our eyes tend to fill in gaps to form complete shapes or letters, so we're able to form the 3 letters IBM at first glance. By the proximity principle, we instinctively join the horizontal lines to form the IBM.

The bee logo (from eye bee m) follows the figure/ground principle, highlighting the bee in the foreground in a dark background.

The symmetry of the text in these job cards makes it easy to locate the information an applicant may look for. However, I feel there is a violation of the similarity principle. The different categories (sales, software engineering, enterprise operations, etc.) are just scattered around the cards with no specific grouping. If the first chunk of cards was one category and the next chunk of cards was another category, it would save the user some time to not have to check the category every time.

There is this one section of the webpage that I feel violates the symmetry principle. Every separate entity on the page seems to have an invisible vertical line going down the page, but that symmetry is broken here. The left alignment of the section doesn't necessarily make it harder to read the content, but it feels like something's missing on the right.

There is good use of the proximity principle throughout the webpage to group elements together, separating them from those farther apart. For example, the open roles section is separated from the entry level programs and the application advice sections. These grouping of elements allow users to see it as one distinct entity on the screen.

In terms of colors, IBM uses blue at its core in conjunction with the simplicity of black and white. The use of these three colors are common across many apps/websites, such as LinkedIn, Messenger, Dropbox, Outlook, Chase, and more. One reason blue is used frequently is its visual accessibility. Another reason is that several statistics online have shown that blue tends to come on top in a favorite color survey. The color blue represents a vast majority of the nature around us from the sky to the sea and it has a psychological impression of serenity and calmness.
