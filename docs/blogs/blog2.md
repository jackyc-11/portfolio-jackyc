# Canvas User Interaction

In class, we discussed the three bridges of user interaction design and applied them to several real life applications. In this blog post, I'll explore the user interaction design of Canvas, an essential tool for both instructors and students. Canvas is a platform we use almost everyday, and its user interaction aims to enable users to effectively engage with course content.

Upon logging in, users are greeted by a dashboard that displays courses in a clean, card-based layout. Accessing assignments, announcements, and grades is straightforward since users are able to simmply click into the card associated with the class they want and navigate to the appropriate tab. On the dashboard, there is a To Do bar on the right side. However, this To Do bar is filled with almost anything other than assignments. It shows recent announcements made as well as upcoming calendar events, which don't really classify as something one would put on their to do list. 

Do you ever look at your inbox or dashboard announcements and see those blue notification circles glaring back at you? A user would have to click through each announcement or inbox thread to mark them as read. There isn't really a mark all as read button. In the inbox, you can check each thread (you would have to click on each checkmark though) in the Unread section and then mark all as read, but at that point, the user might as well just click through each unread message, automatically marking them as read. 

The same thing with notifications applies to grades. When you receive a grade and you haven't clicked on the assignment that was graded, the glaring blue circle appears. Another thing in the Grades tab is that you can manually change your score to a hypothetical score, but for most if not all classes, this is a pretty useless feature since changing the score doesn't change anything else because the average or total grade is not displayed, so this may be a confusing feature.

Do you ever get annoyed by past courses where a professor doesn't hide/remove the Canvas course, and it just stays on your dashboard? Well, they could be "hidden" by you, but the way to do so is not very discoverable. You could go to All Courses and favorite/star the courses that you want to show up on your dashboard. Having something starred will then remove the past enrollments (as well as current enrollments that aren't starred). But guess what? If you go to the Calendar tab, some non-starred courses will still show up in the legend of the calendar (although they may not have any scheduled events), and I'm not sure there's a way to hide that.

Overall, I think Canvas is easy to navigate and performing its core functionalities, such as accessing assignments and seeing grades, is a relatively easy and efficient process. However, there are some features that may seem more unintuitive.
