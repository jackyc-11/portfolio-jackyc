# Interview Planning & Notes

## Hunch/Theme
How might I design a social media app for long distance relationships? It might seem like a dumb question since the idea behind social media was to enable communication for people who are not physically together, but have social media apps really fostered an environment to help with long distance relationships?

## Interviewee Considerations
- uses different platforms to gauge whether the difference in features may result in different concerns/frustrations
- on different scales of long distance relationships (large vs small time zone differences, large vs small distance, romantic vs familial vs platonic, duration of relationship, technological literacy)
- from different generations/age ranges

## Questions to Consider
- Can you tell me about the moment when you first realized that maintaining a long-distance relationship would be a challenge? What were your initial thoughts?
- Describe a typical day of staying in touch. How do you usually communicate?
- Have there been any moments where the distance felt particularly difficult to manage? How did you cope or find ways to stay connected?
- How do you balance digital communication with in-person interactions when you get to see each other?
- Are there any specific rituals or routines you’ve developed to maintain or strengthen the relationship across the distance?
- How has your relationship changed since the transition? Are there any changes in how you communicate or stay connected?
- What are some of the challenges you face when trying to keep up with the other person's daily lives? How do you overcome them?
- How do you think being far away has changed the way you experience important milestones or traditions?
- Can you recall an event or milestone that you missed due to the distance? How did you experience it from afar, and what would have made that experience better for you?

## Interview 1 Notes
- Initial feelings: excited for our opportunities, worried about how distance would affect relationship, fear of drifting apart.
- Been used to seeing each other almost daily at MIT, but being on opposite coasts felt like a huge transition and it hurts to know that I can’t just walk over to her place and unwind like we used to.
- Time difference can be an issue because I need to consider my partner’s time zone whenever texting or calling to make sure it’s not a disruption.
- We have a shared calendar, which also helps to gauge whether the other person is free.
- Typical Day: start the days with good mornings and end the days with good nights. send little updates (every meal we eat) or random messages throughout the day - like if something interesting happens at work or if we see something that reminds us of each other. Towards the evening, we’d try to carve out time for a video call if we’re not too tired to talk or do something together. On weekends, we try to do something more special, like buying the same ingredients to cook and eat together, watching a movie, playing games, or just casually staying on call with each other’s company.
- Anecdote of anniversary: she sent me a playlist of songs that reminded her of us, we sent each other little gifts and snacks/desserts that we would unbox on camera. I received some photos of us back when we were at MIT and that day, we relived some past moments through images and past messages. Photos have been very helpful because we’re both looking at the same thing and are vicariously in that shared moment although we’re thousands of miles apart. Since then, we’ve always done a monthly “memory recap”. We would spend one of our calls reminiscing about a fun memory we shared in person, whether it’s a trip we took together or something as simple as a day we spent at MIT.
- Difficulties: I was going though a particularly stressful period at work, and the demands of my job were taking a toll on me. I really wanted to be with my partner, but we couldn’t always find the time to talk because of our mismatched schedules, and when we did talk, I was often too tired to have deep conversations. It’s really important to make an effort to communicate about how we were both feeling.
- Another thing that helped [to cope with the distance] was planning our next visit. Even though we couldn’t be together right away, having something to look forward to gave us hope and helped us push through the tough times.
- Video calls can sometimes feel repetitive, especially when there’s not much new to talk about or when the conversation starts feeling more like a check-in than a meaningful exchange.
- There’s something irreplaceable about the comfort of just sitting next to my partner, whether we’re having a deep conversation or simply doing nothing at all. It’s those quiet, unspoken moments, like being able to hold her hand, share a hug after a tough day, or even the little things, like walking together or sitting in the same room while doing separate activities.

## Interview 2 Notes
- Felt much more isolated with lack of friends and family; less emphasis on family in the US
- Conversations feel more concise and focused rather than nonchalant and carefree
- After 30 years, we’ve all become used to this style of virtual communication. I left sometime when I was in my teens, and whenever I go back to visit, my parents would still treat me like a child, feeding me with mounds of food and doing all the chores as I relax, just as if I’ve never left and was still their baby girl.
- Mostly rely on video calls and voice messages through WeChat; difficult to find times for long video calls due to complete opposite time zones. I usually just message at night (my time) and then just wait for them to reply when they wake up, and I would reply to their messages when I wake up. I do try my best not to ping them in the middle of their night though.
- Transitioned away from sharing meals, doing chores together, sitting together in the living room → feels more disconnected especially when I miss their birthdays or I can’t be with them when they’re sick (more difficult to offer support and comfort through the screen)
- Often view updates on each others’ lives through WeChat Moments, which is kind of just like Instagram posts. Also share videos and images of family gatherings, meals, or random moments in the family group chat.
- Cultural differences are especially visible in terms of holidays. I celebrate all of the Chinese holidays, such as Dragon Boat Festival and Lantern Festival, with them. For Chinese New Year, I would send my nieces and nephews digital red envelopes (which can be used for digital payments), which is a cool feature on WeChat. However, they don’t celebrate holidays in the US, such as Fourth of July and Thanksgiving, with me since the holidays aren’t part of their culture. For the Chinese holidays, I can’t join them in person either, which makes me feel kind of left out.
- My parents aren’t tech-savvy so it was initially challenging to get them used to video calls or sending voice messages on WeChat. We also can’t simply call over then phone because firstly, we’d like to see each others’ faces and secondly, international phone calls cost money. Over time, they’ve adapted to the use of WeChat.
- When niece or nephew is born, can’t be there to hold them. I remember missing my nephew’s 100 day party, which is an important milestone for newborns in Chinese culture. Always experiencing events secondhand through photos (sense of loss, guilt, sadness; sometimes even feeling like an outsider). I sometimes celebrate with my friends from around here, which definitely makes up for the absence of my immediate family around me.
- My parents don’t really understand what I do, so it’s tough to tell them about my life besides saying I’m doing alright (even when I’m sometimes not). I’m usually the one asking questions about their life, about how to make something, or about gossips/events that has happened in China.
