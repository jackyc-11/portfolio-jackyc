# User Testing & Analysis

## Prepopulate Data
I prepopulated test accounts with data that reflects a user who has been using the app for a good amount of time:
- added a few users as friend on the test account so there's friends on the chat sidebar and the friends list
- sent friend requests to the test account so participants can perform actions on the requests
- set mood for users that the test account is friends with
- entered location to turn on weather sharing for users that the test account is friends with
- included a few post-it notes on the Post-It Wall

## Task List
| Title | Instruction | Rationale
| -------- | ------- | -------
| Add a friend (send a friend request) | Navigate to the friends section, select Add Friends from the friend sidebar, and add a user as friend. | This task will reveal whether users are able to locate the friends section and understand how to initiate a friend request. Beyond that, it'll help me understand how easily it is for a user to locate another user they'd want to befriend.
| Respond to a friend request | Navigate to the friends section, select Friend Requests from the friend sidebar, and choose an action. | This task will help me see if users understand how to respond to friend requests and whether the friend management interface is straightforward. It'll also help me understand if there's any gaps in the gulf of evaluation by witnessing how confident a user feels from the interface messages that they performed the right action after doing so.
| Send a message | Select a user from the chat sidebar, and type in a message to send. | This test will reveal if users know how to locate a contact and initiate a conversation. Testing with users helps determine if they experience any concerns with the text input field or how the message is rendered, allowing me to confirm that the texting flow is smooth and the textbox allows for various types of inputs.
| Update mood map | Open the Mood Map associated with a user by selecting the respective chat, type in or copy and paste an emoji to represent your current mood. Also, view the other user's mood. | This task will check if users understand how to submit their own mood and access others’ emotions easily. The main thing I hope to learn is whether users understand that they'd need to type in an emoji, which is an uncommon way of interaction but is clearly instructed on the interface. A cognitive walkthrough may not fully capture users’ diverse approaches to this task, so observing user behavior helps identify potential pain points in the emoji entry method and any unexpected actions users might try.
| Check weather for a user | Open Weathering With You associated with a user by selecting the respective chat, enter a city and state and click submit, and check the weather conditions for yourself and a friend. | This task will mainly focus on understanding that a user knows that they've taken the right action to overcome the gulf of evalutaion after entering their location by seeing both their own and another user's weather conditions. In a cognitive walkthrough, I can confirm that the location input and weather display function as expected, but testing with users will show if they deem the feedback clear and immediate, which could uncover any misunderstandings about how their action leads to the display of weather data.
| Post on post-it wall | Open Post-It Wall associated with a user by selecting the respective chat, and create a new post with background color and content of your choice. | This task will reveal how easily users can create and customize posts as well as how comfortable users feel with the rendering of the post-it notes on the wall. I'm also interested in seeing the content participants write on these notes to gauge different use cases users may have.
| Edit/Delete post on post-it wall | Click on an existing post-it on the wall, and either delete it or edit its content and save. Drag the post around to desired position. | This task will uncover whether users would easily be aware that further actions could be performed on existing post-it notes. Overall, the focus is to gauge whether the interaction aligns with user expectations for customization and spatial arrangement. I can also evaluate if the dragging functionality feels natural and intuitive.

## Participant 1: Student at Boston University
Participant 1, who we will call Alex, had no trouble performing friend-related tasks in the "friend" section and felt the interface was easy and smooth to navigate. In the "message" section, Alex pointed out a few issues with the text input area and the rendering of each message. The usual Shift + Enter in the text input area doesn't skip to the next line as expected; instead, it sends the message as if pressing Enter. I believe the cause of this discovery is that, from what I witness with my texts with Alex, he frequently structures his messages by skipping lines to separate the text rather than sending two separate texts. Another concern he had was that when there's a lot of text (e.g. you send someone an essay), the text input area continues to overflow horizontally when it should really be expanding vertically up to a certain point. For Mood Map, Alex felt that the X to delete the mood is placed in a confusing place, since based on where it's currently placed, he expected the X to clear the input text rather than the mood. For Weathering With You, Alex was expecting the app to automatically detect his location rather than having to submit one, which I expressed was the intention of the feature but was restricted by Vercel client IP concerns. For Post-It Wall, the font when writing the content was too small. Alex actually knew to drag the post-it note because he was expecting the functionality of a real post-it note. To give off an even more realistic feeling, every note could have a thumbtack when generated, and dragging the note would hide the thumbtack and releasing would show the thumbtack again. We also came to a consensus that the scrollbar should only appear when the note is clicked on to be expanded, and when it is on the wall, the content should be truncated. Alex had a confused facial expression when I changed the content of his post-it note from my account. He did not expect to be able to edit and delete a note made by the other user in the chat because he felt like there's a sense of belonging or authorship. I mentioned that if we were to imagine this in reality, anyone who has access to the board would be able to edit the notes. His overall thoughts on the Post-It wall was that it's a unique and great feature for collaboration. We discussed some potential use cases, such as using it to plan for a party and showing a list of items each person should get. An interesting example mentioned was that the police can use it as a crime board to organize information. He didn't like the app icon on the top left, and I noticed he kept accidentally hovering it as an attempt to click it, probably because it looks somewhat like a button or that's where the message icon usually belongs. Overall, Alex found nothing to be confusing and said that everything is well labeled, making it clear how to get from one place to another. He also claimed, "if messaging wasn't mainly dominated by the OS's native messenger (Android Messages, iMessages), I would definitely use Tether since its features provide good insight into my friends' lives that I wouldn't get otherwise."

## Participant 2: International Student at Yale University
Participant 2, who we will call Bob, made the same claims as Alex did for the "friends" section. Bob commented on the structure of the texting interface, claiming that the length of the container holding the text should be proportional to the length of the text (dynamically sized). He also wished to be able to send images. For Mood Map, Bob was attempting to type something like ": + D" which would convert to :D, or type in some words (e.g. happy) and the corresponding emoji would pop up. I'd assume the instructions weren't very clear since the interface says "Type an emoji". Additionally, only one emoji is allowed, so some clarity, maybe using an exclamation mark that users can click on for help/more information, on these restrictions would've been helpful. He also preferred a dropdown to select emojis over typing in an emoji. Furthermore, although it was clear what the purpose of the X is, it looks unappealing and out of place since it doesn't really look like a button. For Weathering With You, Bob introduced an interesting point I didn't consider. He entered Fuzhou, Fujian as his location since that's where he's from, but Fujian isn't a state. This means that the requirement to enter a city and state can be misleading because foreigners outside the U.S. may use different naming conventions, such as provinces, towns, villages, etc. Additionally, the pink-red background doesn't give off weather vibes; it would be nicer if the background was something that represented weather. One interesting thing Bob was doing after viewing my mood and weather was texting me, "Why are you feeling sad?" or "So jealous of the warm weather where you are," which is important to my app because it goes to show how these features are promoting interations between people. For Post-It Wall, he had a surprised expression when told that the note is draggable as he thought the positioning was simply random, so he wished that was made clear or more intuitive. I think this behavior occurred because there's nothing on the interface that makes the note look draggable or clickable; the user had to have the intuition to reposition or edit the note. One area he said could be improved is the overlapping of post-it notes, which takes precendence based on the most recently created note. However, he felt that it should be the most recently editted note as it replicates reality more. Overall, Bob loved the features because it "allowed users to connect with their friends and family over day to day emotions and intricacies of life." As an international student, his main form of social media is WeChat, and he claimed that it's hard to compare any apps with WeChat since WeChat is a superapp with countless functionalities. However, if he were to isolate the interaction-based features of WeChat, Tether is better at allowing for deeper connections by including features for organization and for checking in on a friend or family. He did also claim that the app may have been easier to use since the population of teenagers, including himself, are well-versed in using social media platforms, but it would be helpful for less technologically literate people to have a tutorial walkthrough to preview each feature and where to navigate.

## Design Flaws/Opportunities
![](a6_media_files\weathering-with-you.png)

1) Both user testing participants expressed confusion regarding the feedback message from Weathering With You. The flaw is that when a user submits their location, which also turns on weather sharing, the user gets a red toast message saying "Both users must agree to share". For privacy reasons, the Tether backend requires that both users turn on weather sharing to see each other's weather information. However, the toast message isn't very suitable because it sounds as if it's yelling at the user who has already turned on sharing, which is a gap in the gulf of execution because users aren't sure if they have properly turned on weather sharing on their side. A better message to display may be "Awaiting {other user's username} to submit location and turn on weather sharing". Alternatively, I can overhaul the design so that the message says "Successfully turned on weather sharing", and the weather information would still appear. However, in your weather information box, it would show the weather conditions, but in the other user's weather information box, it would say "Awaiting {other user's username} to submit location and turn on weather sharing". This is a minor flaw on the linguistic level.

2) From the user tests with Alex and Bob, I gained a lot of insight on improvement opportunities for the UI visual design of Post-It Wall. Both participants mentioned viewing the Post-It Wall in a realistic sense and thought about how they would physically interact with it. Given this, there are several changes to make to the current monochromatic light-brown wall as well as the post-it notes on it. To address the wall, I can use an image of a bulletin board or another realistic surface as the wall. Furthermore, there are post-it notes of different sizes in reality, so the virtual notes should be adjustable in size. The order (which note is in front of another if overlapping) of post-it notes may also differ in reality, so I can make the virtual notes in a way such that a note takes precedence of being in front if it is the most recently editted note because in order to edit a note, you need to take it off the board and then put it back on, thus placing it at the top. These are minor opportunities for improvement on the physical level.

3) Both participants also criticized the X button, which is placed next to the input textbox as shown in the image, in Mood Map. To recap, Alex claimed that he thought it was for clearing the textbox after typing something, and Bob claimed that it looks unappealing since it doesn't resemble a button. In my opinion, it was violation of proximity for Alex because the X was grouped together with the instruction and input textbox, so it's deemed a distinct entity from the rest of the mood map. For Bob, it was a violation of figure/ground because the X is so bold that it sticks out as the foreground on the mood map, which is not the main emphasis/purpose of the mood map. To address this issue, I can make it so that the X is less bolded and potentially even made red, and it only appears next to the emoji set by "You" when the mood is typed using the input textbox. Additionally, to make it look more like a button, I can add a light background color to the X. This way, it will be clear that the X is clickable and used to delete the existing mood to allow the user to type another emoji. These are minor opportunities for improvement on the physical level.
