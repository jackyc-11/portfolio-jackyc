# Impact Case

## Team Contract
All team members are expecting an A on the project and are willing to put in 10-15 hours weekly, adjusted based on the requirements of the specific assignment. Typically, assignments towards the end, like backend and frontend code, would require more time. The following are the personal goals for each team member. Jennet hopes to build a meaningful app. Kevin hopes to build a complete app and get better at Vue because he didn’t spend enough time on the frontend. Jacky hopes that the app is something that target users would actually use. Brian hopes to build a polished app and improve design and frontend skills. The team will be meeting twice a week at the Student Center, once on Thursday 5-6pm to broadly discuss the assignment and assign tasks and once on Monday 2:30-4pm to discuss progress and any potential areas of difficulty and confusion. Time and length of [meetings](https://w2m.shenshen.mit.edu/6104-team-meeting-208829) will be adjusted accordingly if a team member is unable to make the time that week. Quality of work will be maintained through PRs if there are merge conflicts, different branches for version control, and team testing/review to ensure functionality. Tasks will be assigned as evenly as possible based on approximate time and interest. If deadlines are missed, the whole team must be responsible to finish missing requirements by EOD Thursday. Individuals must also communicate ASAP if they aren’t able to meet the deadline for their assigned task, so the team can potentially help out to turn assignment in by EOD Wednesday. Decisions will be made primarily at team meetings, and disagreements will be resolved through meetings with our mentor and professors if necessary.

| A Beginner’s Guide to Sewing with Knitted Fabrics by Wendy Ward ([link](https://wendyward.wordpress.com/2018/01/01/a-beginners-guide-to-sewing-with-knitted-fabrics-an-introduction/)) | This book is a guide to different types of knitted fabrics, what they’re like to work with and wear, and how to choose the best fabric for your project. Wendy Ward worked as a designer in the fashion industry and a knitting teacher, which left her with a love of working with knitted fabrics. | **Support:** Wendy emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate fabric for a project, noting that the choice of fabric can significantly affect the outcome. She highlights that beginners often struggle with understanding fabric properties and matching them to suitable patterns. This illustrates that there is a need for resources that guide sewists through material choices, such as detailed advice on fabric selection.
| Stitching the Future: Technology's Impact on the Sewing Industry ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8gtCvO6rSg)) | Katrina Kay is a sewing enthusiast and educator. This article outlines common mistakes that beginners make when starting their sewing journey. It provides practical advice to help novice sewists avoid these pitfalls, improve their skills, and enjoy a more successful sewing experience. | **Support:** The article covers a variety of issues such as selecting improper fabric, neglecting to read pattern instructions, taking on projects that are too advanced, lacking sufficient project planning, and using incorrect tools. Clearly, there are many aspects beginners struggle with, but some may be easier to learn about and overcome than others, so it’s important to gauge what information is the least accessible to sewers from the stakeholder interviews.
| Stitching the Future: Technology's Impact on the Sewing Industry ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8gtCvO6rSg)) | In this podcast video, Ashley and Bethany explore how modern advancements are enabling sewists to express themselves in ways they could only dream of, and how they're reshaping the industry as a whole. They poke at the awe-inspiring possibilities that technology offers to sewers of all skill levels, from beginners to seasoned experts. | **Support:** When discussing how AI can elevate the sewing experience, Bethany claims she wants to open the door and say “Alexa, good morning to my sewing room, please set up my space to work today, tell me what’s on my to-do list, list what projects I’m working on today, where did I leave off yesterday, do I have any of material X in my stash.” She wants her “space to come to life by the command of her voice”. From this, it seems Bethany wants some software to help her easily maintain information on her work and available materials.
| The Value of Handcrafting in a Technology-Driven World by Marisa Valotta ([link](https://medium.com/quinnipiac-icm506/the-value-of-handcrafting-in-a-technology-driven-world-ad2527250f90)) | This blog post explores the benefits of handcrafting in a world dominated by technology and mass production. The author discusses how engaging in handmade crafts provides a therapeutic escape from the digital world, fosters creativity, and preserves cultural heritage. It emphasizes the mental health benefits of crafting, the value of unique, handmade items, and the importance of slowing down to appreciate traditional, hands-on processes. | **Refute:** The post argues that technology can interfere with the unique, meditative experience of crafting. It highlights how handcrafting fosters a sense of individuality, mental wellness, and cultural connection that is often lost with digital solutions or mass production. This suggests that an app for sewing might detract from the tactile, mindful aspects of the craft, which some sewists value more than convenience or digital organization. When it comes to mindful crafting, there is more than your approach and mindset. One aspect is not using technology since it makes us impatient for immediate results and provides content to be consumed rather than created.
| Ravelry, PatternReview | Many apps offer patterns that include instructions and fabric suggestions. Ravelry is a community site, an organizational tool, and a yarn & pattern database for knitters and crocheters. PatternReview.com is a platform where sewists share reviews, experiences, and tips about various sewing patterns and projects. | **Refute:** Pattern brands have already integrated project organization and material guidance into their software, making additional tools potentially redundant. They’ve also established a large community with extensive pattern reviews and discussions. However, to refute the idea that another app may be redundant, there are complaints that some of these existing apps provide information that is very vague. It’s like a recipe that says to put “a bunch of” sage or “a handful of” salt. Additionally, many sewing apps have an outdated interface. <br><br>**Support:** The discussions and reviews highlight frequent frustrations around pattern selection and project setup, showing demand for a resource that simplifies these processes. Many users mention needing help with finding suitable patterns and managing project stages.

## VSD Analysis
### 1. STAKEHOLDERS

- **Impact: Direct Users (Beginner and Experienced Crafters) -** Users who are new to crafts may feel overwhelmed by advanced techniques, while experts might struggle with a lack of advanced features.
    -  **Mitigation:** Implement a tiered onboarding system to help beginners get started with tutorials and community support. For advanced users, provide a pathway to premium features, like customization options or the ability to sell advanced patterns.
- **Impact: Indirect Users (Competing Sellers & Material Companies) -** There is a risk that sellers on other platforms could lose exclusivity due to pattern reselling or redistribution.
    - **Mitigation:** Add a verification system for patterns, allowing only approved sellers to monetize their patterns. Implement watermarks on downloadable patterns to deter unauthorized resale.
- **Impact: Conflicting Roles for Single Users -** Users who both share and purchase patterns might prioritize their own work or manipulate interactions for self-promotion.
    - **Mitigation:** Create role tags or badges that visually indicate a user’s current role (e.g., "Contributor" vs. "Learner") to distinguish between sellers, experts, and learners, helping the community remain balanced.
- **Impact: Non-Targeted Use (Inappropriate Content or Scams) -** Some users might upload irrelevant or even inappropriate content under the guise of sharing patterns.
    - **Mitigation:** Use automated content moderation combined with community flagging to detect and remove inappropriate content promptly.
- **Impact: Children -** if kids find the website they might also start doing crafts and get creative
    - Help: Providing different types of media would help even kids to learn something new

### 2. TIME
- **Impact: Reappropriation (Shifting to Social Platform) -** Users may convert the platform into a social space for sharing projects, deviating from the original educational and pattern-sharing purpose.
- **Impact: Project Management Tool Repurposing -** Some users may use the platform purely for organizing personal projects, disregarding the community sharing aspect.
Mitigation: Incorporate subtle nudges, such as prompts to share work in progress with the community, which could promote a collaborative environment without forcing public sharing.
- **Impact: Educational Use in Classrooms -** Instructors may use the platform to teach crafting basics and conversions, which could shift its purpose from a general-use app to a more academic or structured learning tool.
    - **Mitigation:** Offer an “Educational Mode” feature that allows teachers to organize projects and highlight fundamental techniques, along with easy-to-use conversion tools. This mode could also include templates and lesson plans tailored for classroom use.
- **Impact: Environmental Consequences of Pattern Sharing -** The ease of accessing patterns may lead to increased material usage, potentially resulting in greater waste if users frequently experiment and discard materials.
    - **Mitigation:** Offer a feature for eco-friendly material recommendations and tips on optimizing material use, plus a “Green Projects” section highlighting sustainable craft projects.
- **Impact: Limiting Creativity through Standardization -** Over time, the platform may inadvertently promote a narrow set of designs and techniques, leading to a homogenization of creative outputs. This is evident in similar patterns seen on 3D-printing websites or YouTube tutorials that generate alike designs, particularly around specific themes. Users might feel confined to these common patterns, stifling innovation and personal expression.
    - **Mitigation:** Introduce features that encourage creative experimentation, such as tools that allow users to remix and adapt existing patterns. Regularly host community challenges or themed events (e.g., “Create Your Own Pattern Month”) to inspire unique contributions and highlight out-of-the-box creativity. Additionally, create a showcase section for unusual or unconventional patterns, providing visibility to diverse crafting approaches and encouraging users to explore beyond standard designs.

### 3. PERVASIVENESS
- **Impact: Geographic Cultural Differences -** Users from different regions have unique crafting styles (for example, in Turkmenistan, people not only sew but also embroider a lot and it is very distinct from western embroidery styles as seen here and here).
    - **Mitigation:** Provide culturally adaptive filters, allowing users to search based on regional styles (e.g., embroidery from Turkmenistan). 
- **Impact: Geographic Cultural Differences -** Users from different regions have different measurement systems, which could create friction for non-U.S. users.
    - **Mitigation:** Integrate automatic measurement conversion tools to accommodate metric and imperial systems.
- **Impact: Barrier to Accessibility for Non-English Speakers -** Language limitations could restrict non-English speakers from fully engaging with the community or understanding instructions.
    - **Mitigation:** Offer multilingual support for critical instructions and community guidelines. Allow for user-submitted translations for patterns to increase accessibility organically.

### 4. VALUES
Desired Values: Ownership, community, environmental sustainability, expression
- **Impact: Ownership and Authorship of Shared Patterns -** As users share or remix patterns, the original creator's sense of ownership may be diluted, leading to conflicts over intellectual property.
    - **Mitigation:** Implement a crediting system that visibly tags the original creator of any remixed patterns. Reward users with badges or points to recognize their contributions, which could maintain the sense of ownership while fostering community.
- **Impact: Sustainability vs. Creativity -** Users often experiment with various materials, but frequent use of synthetics or non-biodegradables could harm the environment.
    - **Mitigation:** Promote eco-conscious crafting by offering guides on sustainable materials and adding a “Sustainable Choice” badge for patterns that use eco-friendly materials. Partner with eco-friendly suppliers to encourage better practices.
- **Impact: Community vs. Personal Success (Competitive Concerns) -** Experts who share their knowledge might feel less incentive if they see others profiting or building off their ideas without recognition.
    - **Mitigation:** Create a leaderboard or recognition system that rewards contributors for popular or helpful content. This could help experts feel valued and encourage ongoing support for the community.
- **Impact: Increased Demand for Non-Sustainable Materials -** With easy access to patterns, users may frequently purchase cheap synthetic materials, contributing to environmental waste.
    - **Mitigation:** Incorporate a “Sustainability Hub” featuring articles, tutorials, and sourcing options for eco-friendly materials. Add eco-filters in search options, prioritizing biodegradable and sustainable materials to educate users and promote responsible purchasing.
- **Impact: Creative Waste Through Experimentation -** Crafting often involves trial and error, leading to material wastage.
    - **Mitigation:** Offer “Eco-Friendly Tips” in pattern instructions, like suggesting material substitutions or techniques that minimize waste. Consider a reward for users who complete projects with sustainable practices, such as a "Green Crafter" badge.
