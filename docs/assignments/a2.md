# Divergent Design

## Broad Application Goals

**Name:** Tether

**Audience:** People in long-distance relationships, whether romantic, familial, or friendly, seeking ways to maintain meaningful connections across physical distances

**Value:** The app strengthens the tether between those in a long-distance relationship through unique features that provide emotional comfort, better communication, and a sense of shared presence. It addresses certain frustrations in maintaining closeness, offering personalized tools to foster emotional connection when physically apart.

## Scrapbook of Comparables
![](a2_media_files\timeline_knight.png)

This screenshot is from a website called Knight Lab Timeline, showing a visual timeline with media elements like images, videos, and links. Could this feature be applied to enable users to share and reminisce about key moments from the past? Users could mark significant events that has happened on a shared timeline along with multimedia to allow them to look back and discuss these precious moments. 

![](a2_media_files\between.png){:width='400'}

This screenshot is from an app called Between, showcasing a shared calendar and notes that provides reminders for tasks and events important to both parties. Could this feature be applied to keep track of and sync upcoming events, both individually or collectively, as a way to coordinate better communication for the future? Users will be able to schedule dates, anniversaries, or other important events in advance and stay connected by having a shared timeline of activities.

![](a2_media_files\wechat.jpg){:width='400'}

This sreenshot is from an app called WeChat, displaying a favorites page to save important messages for easy access. Could this feature be applied to save memorable phrases or important messages from another user for several purposes that could be comedic or serious? In many groups of friends, family, or couples, people have said funny things that should be noted down to look back at or important information that you may need to refer to. Additionally, many users send media related to potential restaurants, travel destinations, home decor, etc. Users are able to get quick access to these messages by favoriting them.

![](a2_media_files\whendo.jpg){:width='400'}

This screenshot is from an app called WhenDo, which allows users to keep track of the time zones of different people, showing multiple people and their respective local times on a single screen. Could ths idea be applied to help users in different time zones coordinate their schedules, with automatic reminders for optimal times to connect, based on both users’ local time? Users are able to determine another person's time to gauge their availability.

![](a2_media_files\spotify.png){:width='600'}

This screenshot is from Spotify, specifically Spotify Wrapped, which is a compilation of a user's activities on the platform over the past year. Could this idea be applied to create a "Year in Review" feature where users get a personalized recap of their most shared moments, video calls, and messages throughout the year?”

![](a2_media_files\duolingo.png){:width='600'}

This screenshot is from Duolingo, featuring their streak feature to motivate language learning. Could this idea be applied to a "relationship streak" feature, where users are encouraged to maintain a streak of daily check-ins, messages, or another form of communication?

![](a2_media_files\touchnote.jpg){:width='300'}

This screenshot is from TouchNote, where users are able to send custom-made cards and meaningful gifts. Could this idea be applied to create a virtual postcard feature in a long-distance relationship app, where users can design personalized postcards with photos, messages, and even location stamps to send to each other digitally or by mail? 

## Feature Ideas
- Memory Stargazing: Users can lock away digital memories (photos, videos, messages) into a time capsule that will open at a future date or milestone (e.g. an anniversary), surprising them both with past memories. Memories are placed as constellations in a virtual night sky. Each star represents a moment, message, or image. Users zoom in to view specific memories, creating a celestial map of their relationship.
- Daily Prompts: The app sends thoughtful conversation starters or reflection prompts each day to help users deepen their connection. Topics can range from fun ("What’s your favorite childhood memory?") to deeper questions ("What’s your biggest dream right now?").
- Mood Map: This feature lets each partner share how they’re feeling throughout the day using emojis, short notes, or GIFs. The app could create a map of each person’s mood over the course of a week, fostering more empathy and understanding.
- Relationship Goals: Partners set goals for their relationship (like taking a trip together, having more video calls, or learning a new hobby) and track progress. The app could give fun suggestions and rewards for hitting these relationship milestones.
- Time Zone Sync: A time zone-aware feature that lets users plan activities (like video calls, games, or watching a movie) at mutually convenient times, without having to calculate time differences. It could also suggest the best time for a call based on both their schedules.
- Amaze: A virtual surprise planner, where users can schedule and send each other surprise gifts, love notes, or small gestures that get delivered on a future date. It could suggest creative ways to surprise each other, adding spontaneity to their relationship.
- What's Cooking: What better way than to bond over food! Share meals virtually by taking pictures of what you’re cooking or eating and sending it to the other person.
- Countdown to Reunion: Reunion is something people typically look forward to, so visibly seeing it can be motivating at times. Of course, it may also be tough if that time is very long, so this feature should be able to be turned off and on.
- Long-Distance Garden: A virtual garden that grows based on interaction frequency. Each message, call, or shared moment plants new flowers or trees, which bloom the more the users interact. It serves as a visual metaphor for nurturing their relationship. This can be linked to other features that gives rewards (e.g. Relationship Goals) by potentially being able to include new plants and even pets in the garden.
- Secret Soundscapes: Users record ambient sounds from their surroundings (like city noise, nature, or a favorite cafe) and send them as secret soundscapes, allowing them to experience each other's environments auditorily.
- ShareCal: A shared calendar where people can mark important moments in life. Knowing important dates can greatly help with long distance relationships, whether it’s a couples’ anniversary, a joyful family event, or even an important hospital visit.
- Tether Wrapped: Users get a personalized recap of their most shared moments, emojis, media, video calls, and messages throughout the year.
- Tether Streaks: Users are encouraged to maintain a relationship streak of daily check-ins, messages, or another form of communication.
- Post-It Wall: A digital "post-it wall" where users can leave sticky notes for each other throughout the day, visible on their partner’s home screen. These can be simple notes like "good luck at work!" or "don’t forget to smile today," offering ongoing encouragement and affection.
- Weathering With You: An app feature that merges both users’ local weather into one shared screen, giving you an idea of what the weather is like for each other in real-time. It adds a small, meaningful way to connect over environmental differences and similarities.

## VSD Analysis
- Direct Stakeholders: romantic partners, family members, close friends, migrants, immigrants, students studying abroad, frequent travelers, etc.
- Indirect Stakeholders: therapists/counselors, event planners, travel agencies, etc.
- Non-targeted Use: Features like Time Zone Sync could be misused by controlling or possessive individuals to monitor someone's availability, pushing boundaries of personal time. Both users would need to have this feature turned on and there should be privacy and boundary settings that allow users to choose what information is shared. 
- Long-Term Health and Well-Being: Daily maintenance of Tether Streaks could lead to a feeling of pressure or stress. Introduce a "grace period" mode that allows users to pause certain interactions like streaks or goal tracking without penalty. This would prevent emotional burnout and reinforce that relationships are about quality, not quantity of interactions. Additionally, daily interaction with features like Countdown to Reunion may increase anticipation but could also intensify feelings of anxiety if the reunion is far off. Allow users to customize this feature, giving them control over whether to display or hide the countdown based on their emotional readiness. This respects their mental well-being.
- Reappropriation: Over time, Tether might be used for purposes outside of maintaining relationships, such as group networking or workplace coordination. Features like Post-It Wall may be used to encourage employees in a virtual environment. Group profiles can be extended for other types of relationships and communities where emotional bonds or shared experiences continue to matter, such as support groups, study groups, communities of practice, etc.
- Widespread Use: As Tether scales to millions of users, the risk is that as more people adopt the app, interactions become diluted, or the app becomes less personal. New interactions could emerge, leading to unexpected community dynamics, such as cross-cultural exchanges or new ways to foster virtual intimacy. To include a dimension of collective participation, we can incorporate World Windows, a feature that links strangers in different time zones or countries via shared moments. The app might prompt users to take part in global challenges, like "Show what your sunset looks like today" or "Share the sound of the rain." Through this feature, users can connect with others going through similar emotions or experiences across the globe.
- Value Tensions: Tether is designed to foster deep emotional connection between users through intimate sharing of messages, moods, or sounds (e.g. Secret Soundscapes, Mood Map). However, sharing personal information and emotional states may compromise a user’s sense of privacy, especially if sensitive data is misused or shared without clear boundaries. Implement a Selective Sharing Mode where users can adjust privacy settings for each feature, allowing them to limit what is shared (e.g., only sharing moods with specific individuals or choosing whether to send ambient sounds). There's also tensions between consistency and autonomy with features like Tether Streaks.
