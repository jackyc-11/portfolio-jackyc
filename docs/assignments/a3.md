# Convergent Design

## Pitch
Stay Connected, No Matter the Distance! Tether is inventing new ways for people to express themselves and be together with their favorite people. Tether is designed for people in long distance relationships, whether romantic partners, family members, or close friends, who seek to maintain meaningful connections across physical distances. At its core, Tether ensures secure and continuous access through user authentication and session management, allowing seamless communication across time zones. Recognizing that relationships can experience strain, Tether employs a non-use feature, allowing users to hide features, pause notifications, and mute interactions.

Communication is key to keeping relationships strong and healthy, and Tether facilitates this through real time and asynchronous messaging, as well as video calling to provide face to face interactions. Users can also share their emotional states using a mood mapping feature, offering a quick and intuitive way to stay updated on each other’s wellbeing throughout the day. Tether's post-it wall feature also allows users to write cute or funny notes that the recipient can view. However, connections aren't just about words; it’s about shared experiences. Just as food brings people together, Tether’s meal sharing feature allows users to bond by exchanging meal photos and potentially sharing recipes. 

Whether it’s a heartfelt message, a spontaneous video call, or a meal shared across miles, Tether strengthens relationships and turns distance into a powerful means of connection.

## Concepts
1) **Authenticating**

*Purpose:* <br>
Authenticate users so that app users correspond to people.

*Operational Principle:* <br>
After a user registers with a username and password pair, they can authenticate as that user by providing the same pair of username and password.

*State:* <br>
registered: set User <br>
username, password: registered &rarr; one String

*Actions:* <br>
register(name, pass: String, out user: User) <br>
authenticate(name, pass: String, out user: User)

2) **Sessioning**

*Purpose:* <br>
Enable authenticated actions for an extended period of time.

*Operational Principle:* <br>
After a session starts and before it ends (manually ended or automatically timed out), the getUser action returns the user identified at the start.

*State:* <br>
active: set Session <br>
user: active &rarr; one User

*Actions:* <br>
start(user: User, out sess: Session) <br>
getuser(sess: Session, out user: User) <br>
end(sess: Session)

3) **Texting**

*Purpose:* <br>
Enable users to send and receive textual messages.

*Operational Principle:* <br>
After a user sends a message to another user, the recipient can read the message.

*State:* <br>
messages: set Message <br>
sender, recipient: messages &rarr; one User <br>
content: messages &rarr; one String <br>
timestamp: messages &rarr; one Time

*Actions:* <br>
send(sender: User, recipient: User, content: String, out message: Message) <br>
receive(recipient: User, sender: User, out message: Message)

4) **Video Calling**

*Purpose:* <br>
Allow users to engage in real-time video communication.

*Operational Principle:* <br>
When a user initiates a video call and the recipient accepts, both users (caller and recipient) can see and hear each other until one of them ends the call.

*State:* <br>
activeCalls: set Call <br>
caller, recipient: activeCalls &rarr; one User <br>
userInCall: User &rarr; one Call <br>
startTime, endTime: activeCalls &rarr; one Time

*Actions:* <br>
startCall(caller: User, recipient: User, out call: Call) <br>
endCall(call: Call)

5) **Setting Moods**

*Purpose:* <br>
Allow users to set and display a status or emotional state.

*Operational Principle:* <br>
Users can select an emoji to represent their mood or status, which will be displayed to the chat until updated or removed.

*State:* <br>
moods: set Mood <br>
user: moods &rarr; one User

*Actions:* <br>
setMood(user: User, out mood: Mood) <br>
removeMood(user: User)

6) **Post-It Wall**

*Purpose:* <br>
Allow users to create and display short posts on a virtual wall.

*Operational Principle:* <br>
Users can post notes or messages on their wall, and these posts remain visible until they are removed by the user.

*State:* <br>
posts: set Post <br>
author: posts &rarr; one User <br>
content: posts &rarr; one String

*Actions:* <br>
createPost(author: User, content: String, out post: Post) <br>
deletePost(post: Post) <br>
viewWall(user: User, out posts: set Post)

7) **Friending**

*Purpose:* <br>
Allow users to establish connections with other users, forming a mutual friendship.

*Operational Principle:* <br>
A user can send a friend request to another user. If accepted, the two users become friends, allowing them to interact with different features in the app.

*State:* <br>
friends: set Friendship <br>
user1, user2: friends &rarr; one User <br>
pendingRequests: set Request <br>
sender, recipient: pendingRequests &rarr; one User

*Actions:* <br>
sendFriendRequest(sender: User, recipient: User, out request: Request) <br>
acceptFriendRequest(request: Request, out friendship: Friendship) <br>
rejectFriendRequest(request: Request) <br>
removeFriend(friendship: Friendship)

**Other Potential Concepts:** What's Cooking, Counting Down, Weather Tracking

## Wireframes

## Tradeoffs
1) Post-It Wall x What's Cooking
    - Options: Combine or separate the concepts of Post-It Wall (allows users to display posts/notes on a virtual wall) and What's Cooking (allows users to share images of their meals).
    - Rationale: Both concepts follow the idea of sharing an item with another user, so given the limited concepts allowed, I could've chose to combine them. However, I asked my friends about the features, and some claimed that they would use the What's Cooking feature more over the Post-It Wall feature. Ultimately, I decided that food deserves its own special place separate from the virtual wall. 

2) Friends x Birthdays
    - Options: Include or exclude a birthday tab in the friends section where users can see upcoming birthdays of their friends and receive notifications on the day.
    - Rationale: I included a birthday tab in my wireframe, but I haven't discussed birthdays anywhere in A3. I'm still thinking about it and hope to make a decision by A4, but I'm leaning towards including birthdays because knowing important dates is important to long distance relationships, and birthdays are undoubtedly an important date. I'm sure most people prefer "birthdays are so special" over "birthdays are just another day".

3) Mood Map for All vs for One
    - Options: Users set one mood, which is displayed universally to all their friends across the app OR users can set a different mood for each chat.
    - Rationale: I chose one mood per chat because it allows users to express different feelings to different people. This choice reflects how people naturally interact with others in real life. We may share excitement and positivity with one person while conveying a more neutral or serious tone to another. Additionally, we may be more vulnerable and open to people we have a stronger connection to. This flexibility caters to users' desire for personal expression and acknowledges that relationships between different people can differ significantly.
